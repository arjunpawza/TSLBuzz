"As a result of the meetings held over these days, all sides agreed to report back in their capitals on each aspect of the negotiations and to coordinate further steps with their leaders."</p><p>The Abu Dhabi talks followed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/witkoff-kushner-scheduled-meet-putin-moscow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meeting in Moscow</a> on Thursday between Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Josh Gruenbaum, the head of the Federal Acquisition Service.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-alleges-attack-putin-residence-ukraine-denies-claim-ahead-trump-talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUSSIA ALLEGES ATTACK ON PUTIN RESIDENCE AS UKRAINE DENIES CLAIM AHEAD OF TRUMP TALKS</strong></a></p><p>Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the "extremely frank" discussions lasted roughly four hours and included U.S. officials updating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moscow on their recent conversations</a> with Ukrainian and European leaders.</p><p>"Importantly, the participants in the conversation between the President of Russia and the Americans reaffirmed the fact that bringing about a lasting settlement would be unlikely without addressing the territorial issue based on the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/anchorage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formula as agreed in Anchorage</a>," Ushakov said, according to a summary of the meeting from the Kremlin.</p><p>Territorial issues remain a key obstacle in the negotiations, with Moscow pressing Kyiv to relinquish parts of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region that Russian forces do not fully control.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-discuss-territory-trump-says-both-sides-want-make-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUSSIA, UKRAINE TO DISCUSS TERRITORY AS TRUMP SAYS BOTH SIDES ‘WANT TO MAKE A DEAL’</strong></a></p><p>The diplomatic efforts come as Russia continues its strikes across Ukraine, targeting the country’s energy sector, critical infrastructure and residential areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-russia-crossroads-how-war-evolved-2025-what-comes-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UKRAINE-RUSSIA AT A CROSSROADS: HOW THE WAR EVOLVED IN 2025 AND WHAT COMES NEXT</strong></a></p><p>Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Russian forces had launched more than 1,700 attack drones, over 1,380 guided aerial bombs and 69 missiles in the past week alone.</p><p>The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>said ahead</u></a> of the trilateral talks that it was deploying 447 emergency generators to help restore power to hospitals, shelters and critical services, as more than one million Ukrainians face outages amid freezing temperatures.</p><p>"The EU will not let Russia freeze Ukraine into submission and will continue helping Ukrainians get through this winter," the commission said.</p>
