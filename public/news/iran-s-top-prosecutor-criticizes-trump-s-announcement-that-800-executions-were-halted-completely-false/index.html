  <h2>Iran&#39;s top prosecutor criticizes Trump&#39;s announcement that 800&#43; executions were halted: &#39;Completely false&#39;</h2>

  

  <div class="content">
    <p>Iran’s top prosecutor pushed back Friday on a recent announcement from President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Donald Trump</u></a> that Iran canceled more than 800 executions, alleging that the president’s remarks are "completely false." </p><p>Trump wrote on Truth Social last week, "I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!" </p><p>However, Iran’s top prosecutor, Mohammad Movahedi, said Friday that, "This claim is completely false; no such number exists, nor has the judiciary made any such decision," according to The Associated Press. </p><p>"We have a separation of powers, the responsibilities of each institution are clearly defined, and we do not, under any circumstances, take instructions from foreign powers," Movahedi reportedly added in comments published by the Iranian judiciary’s Mizan news agency.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-credits-halted-iran-executions-holding-off-military-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP CREDITS HALTED IRAN EXECUTIONS FOR DELAYING MILITARY STRIKES</strong></a></p><p>When asked for reaction Friday, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>White House official</u></a> told Fox News Digital that Trump is monitoring the situation in Iran very seriously and that all options remain available if the regime in Tehran executes protesters. </p><p>The official added that <a class="Hyperlink SCXW231573251 BCX0" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-u-s-take-very-strong-action-against-iran-regime-starts-hanging-protesters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>following Trump’s warnings</u></a> to Iran, demonstrators who were set to be sentenced to death there were not. </p><p>The White House official also said Trump believes this is good news and is hoping the trend continues.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-soldier-sentenced-death-refusing-fire-protesters-nationwide-unrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>IRANIAN SOLDIER SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR REFUSING TO FIRE ON PROTESTERS DURING NATIONWIDE UNREST</u></strong></a></p><p>"What I will say with respect to Iran is that the president and his team have communicated to the Iranian regime that if the killing continues, there will be grave consequences," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters last week. </p><p>As of Friday, there have been 5,032 deaths during the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>crackdown against anti-government protesters</u></a> in Iran, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-crackdown-death-toll-acb1968a973f19be217ea28b4a7adb0b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the AP reported,</a> citing the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.</p><p>Iran’s government offered its first death toll Wednesday, saying 3,117 people had been killed. It claimed that 2,427 of the dead in the demonstrations that began Dec. 28 were civilians and security forces, with the rest being "terrorists." </p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i> </p>
