I would not be the swimmer or person am today without your support," he captioned the post. "To my Canadian teammates, thank you. You helped me progress into the person I am today. You guys really made me feel like I was part of a family. It’s been an honor wearing the Maple Leaf flag and everyone in Canada will always have my support."</p><p>Kharun said he "always felt like an American" despite the immense support from Canada.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ioc-responds-usopc-letter-katie-uhlaenders-petition-olympic-spot-after-team-canada-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IOC RESPONDS TO USOPC LETTER ON KATIE UHLAENDER'S PETITION FOR OLYMPIC SPOT AFTER TEAM CANADA CONTROVERSY</strong></a></p><p>"I grew up in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas</a>.
