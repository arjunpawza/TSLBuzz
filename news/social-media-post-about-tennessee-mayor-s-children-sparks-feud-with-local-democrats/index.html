  <h2>Social media post about Tennessee mayor&#39;s children sparks feud with local Democrats</h2>

  

  <div class="content">
    <p>Hamilton County, Tenn., Mayor Weston Wamp found himself in a heated online exchange with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/state-and-local" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local Democratic officials</a> this week after comments from a community member about Planned Parenthood on his Facebook page sparked sharp criticism and a public political clash.</p><p><a href="https://www.chattanoogan.com/2026/1/25/513886/Weston-Wamp-Democrats-Spar-Over.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According to Chattanooga's Local 3 News</a>, the exchange occurred after a commenter weighed in on a post featuring Wamp's family last Christmas, writing, "This is why we need Planned Parenthood, this picture right here."</p><p>Wamp, a Republican, took a screenshot of the comment and wrote in a separate post, "Recently, a commenter on my family Christmas post suggested that my children were a reason why we need Planned Parenthood. </p><p>"I found that vile comment deeply out of step with the values of Hamilton County," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-gop-win-shows-tennessee-hasnt-been-californiad-least-not-yet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DAVID MARCUS: GOP WIN SHOWS TENNESSEE HASN’T BEEN CALIFORNIA’D, AT LEAST NOT YET</strong></a></p><p>Wamp also shared a screenshot of a post from Former Vice Chair of the Hamilton County Democratic Party Kathy Lennon, which detailed how she had spent the weekend at a "Campaign Crash Course" with Planned Parenthood.</p><p>"Now, we also see <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/democratic-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrat activists</a> proudly training with Planned Parenthood for 2026 campaigns. Relying on Planned Parenthood for campaign training is a new low for the local Democratic Party," Wamp continued in the caption, per Local 3 News.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-keep-crucial-congressional-seat-gop-hands-special-election-victory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP-BACKED REPUBLICAN KEEPS CRUCIAL CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN GOP HANDS WITH SPECIAL ELECTION VICTORY</strong></a></p><p>Wamp, according to local outlet <a href="https://www.chattanoogan.com/2026/1/25/513886/Weston-Wamp-Democrats-Spar-Over.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Chattanoogan</a>, characterized the images as representing two "very different visions for the future of Hamilton County."</p><p>The local Democratic Party fired back in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HamCoDems/posts/hamilton-county-democratic-party-is-disappointed-by-county-mayor-weston-wamps-de/1304308528408494/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a Facebook post</a>, writing, "Hamilton County Democratic Party is disappointed by County Mayor Weston Wamp’s decision to manufacture outrage on social media rather than focus on the real work facing Hamilton County.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-surge-tennessee-throws-new-uncertainty-onto-gops-2026-house-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>DEMOCRATS’ SURGE IN TENNESSEE THROWS NEW UNCERTAINTY ONTO GOP'S 2026 HOUSE MAP</u></strong></a></p><p>"The County Mayor chose to elevate a vague, drive-by online comment into a political spectacle — framing it as a personal attack and using it to smear political opponents. That approach may generate attention, but it does not solve problems or move our community forward," they added. </p><p>The statement continued, pointing out infrastructure problems in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">city of Chattanooga</a>, while accusing Wamp of "govern[ing] from the comment section," and "engaging in performative politics rather than delivering results."</p><p>Wamp did not immediately respond to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital's</a> request for comment.</p>
