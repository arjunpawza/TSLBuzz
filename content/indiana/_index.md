## Indiana Hoosiers: A Historic 2025 Season

<p>The Indiana Hoosiers football team in 2025 delivered one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college football history. Under second-year head coach Curt Cignetti, the Hoosiers went a perfect 15-0, captured their first outright Big Ten title since 1945, won their first Big Ten Championship Game, earned the No. 1 seed in the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff (CFP), and advanced to the national championship game against Miami. This season shattered program records, including the first undefeated regular season in modern history, the highest national rankings ever (No. 1 in AP, Coaches, and CFP polls), and the program's first Heisman Trophy winner.</p>

<h3>Coach Curt Cignetti: The Architect of the Turnaround</h3>
<p>Curt Cignetti, hired after the 2023 season from James Madison, transformed Indiana from a perennial underachiever into a national powerhouse. In his first year (2024), he led the Hoosiers to an 11-2 record, their first CFP appearance, and Big Ten Coach of the Year honors. In 2025, he repeated as Big Ten Coach of the Year (sweeping both coaches' and media awards) and earned national accolades, including the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year.</p>
<p>Cignetti's philosophy emphasizes "production over potential," aggressive transfer portal use, and building depth with experienced players. His high-energy style, memorable quotes like "Google me," and focus on culture flipped the script on a program with the most all-time losses in FBS history. He signed an eight-year extension in October 2025 worth around $93 million, securing his future through 2033.</p>

<h3>Key Team Members and Roster Highlights</h3>
<p>The 2025 roster blended elite transfers, returning talent, and breakout performers. Here's a look at the standouts:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Quarterback Fernando Mendoza (RS-Jr., 6'5", 225 lbs, Transfer from California):</strong> The Heisman Trophy winner became the first Hoosier to claim the award. He completed 73% of his passes for 3,349 yards, 41 touchdowns, and just 6 interceptions in the regular season (stats including bowls reached higher totals, with team passing at 3,640 yards and 46 TDs). Mendoza's precision, decision-making, and leadership fueled the explosive offense. His brother, Alberto Mendoza, provided solid backup play.</li>
    <li><strong>Running Back Roman Hemby (Sr.):</strong> Led the ground game with 1,060 rushing yards and 7 touchdowns on 5.0 yards per carry. The veteran complemented the passing attack perfectly.</li>
    <li><strong>Wide Receivers Omar Cooper Jr. and Elijah Sarratt:</strong> Cooper Jr. was a big-play threat, while Sarratt stretched defenses deep.</li>
    <li><strong>Offensive Line:</strong> Anchored by transfers like Pat Coogan (from Notre Dame), who earned Rose Bowl MVP honors—the first offensive lineman to do so since 1944.</li>
    <li><strong>Defense:</strong> A stingy unit allowed low points, with standouts including linebacker Rolijah Hardy (team-high tackles and sacks) and defensive linemen like C.J. West and Stephen Daley (Kent State transfers). The secondary forced turnovers effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The roster featured heavy transfer influence (e.g., Mendoza from Cal, pieces from JMU continuity), but Cignetti's development turned them into a cohesive, dominant group. The team ranked high nationally in scoring offense (around 42+ PPG) and defense.</p>

<h3>2025 Season Regular Season and Path to the Final</h3>
<p>Indiana started ranked No. 20 and climbed steadily, finishing the regular season 12-0 (9-0 Big Ten)—their first perfect regular season without ties in the overtime era.</p>
<p>Key regular-season highlights:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dominant non-conference wins: 27-14 over Old Dominion, 56-9 over Kennesaw State, 73-0 over Indiana State.</li>
    <li>Big Ten blowouts and statement victories: Crushed No. 9 Illinois 63-10, won at No. 3 Oregon 30-20 (first road top-5 win), beat Michigan State 38-13, UCLA 56-6, Maryland 55-10, Wisconsin 31-7, and Purdue 56-3.</li>
    <li>Clutch road wins: At Iowa 20-15, at Penn State 27-24 (first-ever in Happy Valley).</li>
    <li>Big Ten Championship: Defeated No. 1 Ohio State 13-10 in Indianapolis for the program's first conference title since 1967 and first outright since 1945.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hoosiers earned the No. 1 seed in the CFP with a first-round bye.</p>

<h3>CFP Run:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Quarterfinal (Rose Bowl, Jan. 1, 2026):</strong> Crushed No. 9 Alabama 38-3. This marked Indiana's first Rose Bowl win, first bowl victory since 1991, and a dominant defensive performance holding the Tide to 3 points.</li>
    <li><strong>Semifinal (Peach Bowl, Jan. 9, 2026):</strong> Rematched and routed No. 5 Oregon 56-22. Mendoza threw five touchdowns in a rematch of their regular-season thriller, showcasing offensive firepower.</li>
</ul>
<p>This advanced Indiana to the CFP National Championship against No. 10 Miami (13-2) on Jan. 19, 2026, at Hard Rock Stadium—their first national title game appearance ever.</p>

<h3>Statistical Dominance and Legacy</h3>
<p>The Hoosiers led nationally in key categories, with balanced offense (high yards, points) and elite defense (low points allowed). Mendoza's Heisman win, multiple top-10 victories, and undefeated run made this season legendary.</p>


<p>The 2025 Indiana Hoosiers football team rewrote history under Curt Cignetti, turning doubters into believers and elevating Bloomington to the center of the college football universe. From Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza to dominant playoff wins over Alabama and Oregon, this undefeated 15-0 campaign (heading into the title game) stands as the greatest in program history. Whether they cap it with a national championship or not, the Hoosiers proved that with the right vision, culture, and talent acquisition, even the most unlikely programs can reach the pinnacle.</p>
