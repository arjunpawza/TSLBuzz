<h3>Online Streaming Options (Paid)</h3>
<p>All legitimate live streams require access to ESPN. The game is not available on ESPN+ (the standalone streaming service does not carry playoff games; it's limited to regular-season select content). Use authenticated streaming via the ESPN App, WatchESPN.com, or the NCAA football streaming hub.</p>
<p>Popular paid live TV streaming services that include ESPN:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fubo</strong> — Highly recommended for sports fans; includes ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, and more. Offers a free trial (typically 7 days for new users — check current offers as they vary). Plans start around $80+/month after trial. Stream via fubo.tv or the app.</li>
    <li><strong>YouTube TV</strong> — Carries ESPN and the full family networks. Often includes a free trial period (e.g., promotional offers). Base plan around $73/month (prices fluctuate; check for current deals).</li>
    <li><strong>Hulu + Live TV</strong> — Bundles ESPN with Disney+ and Hulu content. Includes ESPN networks; free trial available for new subscribers (typically 3 days). Starts at ~$77/month.</li>
    <li><strong>DirecTV Stream</strong> — Features ESPN; promotional pricing (e.g., first month discounted to ~$50-90 depending on package). Good for local channels too.</li>
    <li><strong>Sling TV</strong> — Cheaper option (Orange package includes ESPN); starts at ~$40/month. No full free trial but occasional promos or day/weekend passes for sports events.</li>
</ul>
<p>To watch directly:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Download the ESPN App (iOS, Android, Roku, Fire TV, smart TVs, etc.) or go to espn.com/watch.</li>
    <li>Sign in with credentials from your TV provider or streaming service.</li>
    <li>Access via the NCAA football streaming hub on ESPN platforms for enhanced features.</li>
</ul>
<p>These services work on phones, tablets, computers, smart TVs, and streaming devices. Use a VPN if traveling internationally (but check terms for geo-restrictions).</p>

<h3>Free Streaming Options</h3>
<p>There are no official free live streams for the CFP National Championship in the U.S., as ESPN's exclusive rights prevent free over-the-air or ad-supported options like Peacock or Paramount+ (which don't carry this game). Avoid illegal pirate sites — they risk malware, poor quality, and legal issues.</p>
<p>However, legitimate "free" access often comes via free trials from streaming services:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fubo or YouTube TV free trials (if eligible as a new user) — Sign up before kickoff, watch the game, and cancel to avoid charges (read cancellation policies carefully).</li>
    <li>Some cable providers offer free ESPN streaming to subscribers via apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>For international fans (e.g., outside the U.S.), check local broadcasters or free trials on global platforms, but U.S. geo-blocks apply without a VPN.</p>

<h3>Location Options and In-Person Viewing</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>In-Person at Hard Rock Stadium (Miami Gardens, FL):</strong> Tickets are sold out or extremely expensive (average resale ~$3,500+ for entry-level). If attending, arrive early for tailgating, security (clear bag policy), and festivities. The stadium is home to the Miami Hurricanes and Dolphins — parking and traffic will be heavy.</li>
    <li><strong>Watch Parties/Public Viewing:</strong> Many bars, restaurants, and university campuses (especially in Indiana and Miami areas) host official watch parties. Check local listings or ESPN/college sites for events.</li>
    <li><strong>Travel Considerations:</strong> If in Miami or nearby (e.g., South Florida), stadium access is straightforward via public transit or rideshare. For remote viewers in places like Dhaka (as of January 13, 2026, ~11:48 PM local time means ~12:48 PM ET — plenty of time before the 7:30 p.m. ET kickoff), streaming is ideal with no location barriers beyond internet access.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Direct Watch Links and Tips</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Official Direct Stream: espn.com/watch or the ESPN App (authenticate first).</li>
    <li>Countdown: As of January 13, 2026 (~1 day until kickoff), set reminders for 5:00 p.m. ET pregame.</li>
    <li>Pro Tip: Test your streaming setup early — log in, check device compatibility, and ensure a stable connection for HD/4K viewing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This historic matchup — Indiana chasing perfection and a first title, Miami aiming for glory at home — deserves the best viewing experience. Tune in legally on ESPN or a supported streamer for crystal-clear action, expert commentary, and no interruptions. Enjoy the game!</p>
